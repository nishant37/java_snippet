RotateArray_right.java: This java file demonstrates the java program when the array is rotated by right hand side according to the given value. For example:  
int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
int k =3;
Solution: 5,6,7,1,2,3,4

selection_sort.java: This java file demonstrates the selection sort in java.

insertion_sort.java: This java file demonstrates the insertion sort in java.

square_sorted.java: This java file shows the solution of the problem in which array is given whose elements are squared and then sorted according to the ascending order.
Example: int arr[] = {-4,-1,0,3,10};
Output: 0 1 9 16 100 

subset_array_hash.java: This java file checks if the given array is the subset of another array using the hash function.

subset_array_sorting_merging: This java file checks if the given array is the subset of another array using merging and sorting techniques.


bubble_sort.java: This file demonstrates the bubble sort in java.
